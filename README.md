# EasyDriv_GPS 2021/22
With this project we expect to fulfill the need for an easier way to organize and schedule the cars provided by a company. 

We intend to introduce in the company a software that does away with the problems that the current systems bring. EasyDriv will make the reservation of the vehicle and notice super important data. With an analysis system several recommendations will be made to the administrators.

The administrator will be responsible for adding cars and managing users within the software. Regular users have access to the list of available cars as well as the schedules available, this way they can make a booking for a vehicle by choosing one of these cars and respective schedules. The manager user will have access to the software's metrics (more specifically, user requests off vehicle and schedules) and thus find out whether or not it is necessary to add more cars or more availability of these in order to take care of users' needs. In this way, with roles and responsibilities well defined, we believe that the company will make the best possible use of the software. 

Features

- Add/Edit/Remove vehicle: The software administrator must be able to perform all necessary operations on a vehicle. The data collected during the addition of a vehicle must be generic, such as: Make, Model, Registration, Fuel Type, Number of available seats. 

- Add/Edit/Remove user: The software administrator must be able to perform all necessary operations on a user. It is important to keep data such as: Name, Age, Driving License Number, Driving License Issue Date, Driving Type, Etc. 

-Change vehicle availability: For a variety of reasons, a vehicle can be inoperative. This change of status must be done by the Manager User. 

- Book vehicle: To make a vehicle reservation, several details must be filled in: Date and time, required project, user who will make the reservation. This feature is the core of the software: after filling in the needs, the software must be able to identify which vehicles are available to carry out the trip. 

- Share Destination: If the city destination match with another booked vehicle, in case it has enough seats available, the system automatically suggests that vehicle. 

- Cancel booking: The user must be able to cancel the reservations he made (only and only the ones he made). In this way, the vehicle becomes available. 

- Deliver vehicle: After a trip, the user must go to the software to fill in the time at which he delivered the vehicle and how many km's he accomplished. Before confirmation the user will be asked if the car has issues or something gone wrong among the trip. In case user respond yes there will be shown a list with check boxes to fill with most common problems. 

- Car maintenance: Based on the list filled when the car is delivered the system save this info of all the cars registered on the software.
