# EasyDriv_GPS 2021/22
With this project we expect to fulfill the need for an easier way to organize and schedule the cars provided by a company. 

We intend to introduce in the company a software that does away with the problems that the current systems bring. EasyDriv will make the reservation of the vehicle and notice super important data. With an analysis system several recommendations will be made to the administrators.

The administrator will be responsible for adding cars and managing users within the software. Regular users have access to the list of available cars as well as the schedules available, this way they can make a booking for a vehicle by choosing one of these cars and respective schedules. The manager user will have access to the software's metrics (more specifically, user requests off vehicle and schedules) and thus find out whether or not it is necessary to add more cars or more availability of these in order to take care of users' needs. In this way, with roles and responsibilities well defined, we believe that the company will make the best possible use of the software.
